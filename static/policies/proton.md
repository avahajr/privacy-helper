## 1. Legal Framework

We are also GDPR compliant, with **Proton Europe sàrl** as the designated representative in the European Union for GDPR purposes.

## 2. Data Proton Collects and Usage

Our goal is to collect as little user information as possible to provide a private experience. We cannot access the content of your encrypted emails, files, calendar events, passwords, or notes.

**Data collection includes:**

### 2.1 Website Visits

We employ a local installation of self-developed analytics tools. Analytics are anonymized and stored locally. **IP addresses are not retained.**

### 2.2 Account Creation

Creating a Proton Account enables access to all our Services. You may create an account with a Proton Mail address or an external (non-Proton) address. While no personal information is required, you can provide an email address for notification or password recovery purposes. Such data is used solely for communication related to security, verification, or recovery.

Verification measures (e.g., Proton Captcha, email, SMS) may be employed to prevent spam and abuse, with IP and email addresses stored temporarily. If saved permanently, data is stored as cryptographic hashes.

### 2.3 Referral Program

Proton offers a referral program. If you join via a referral, your subscription may be attributed to the referrer, and we may communicate with third-party referral platforms to credit referrers.

### 2.4 Account Activity

Account-related data may be processed to detect abuse or fraud. Legal basis: **Legitimate interest.**

### 2.5 IP Logging

By default, we do not keep permanent IP logs. However, logs may be retained temporarily to prevent abuse or fraud. If you enable **authentication logging**, IP addresses related to login attempts are stored while the feature is enabled. This feature is off by default.

### 2.6 Communications with Proton

Customer support and communication requests may be saved. We may use third-party processors (e.g., Zendesk). Legal basis: **Legitimate interest.**

### 2.7 Sales Team Communications

Data provided through sales inquiries is used solely for responding to business requests. Legal basis: **Consent.**

### 2.8 Communications from Proton

You may receive communications, including promotional emails, from us. **Unsubscribe** anytime through your Account settings.

### 2.9 Payment Information

We use **Chargebee** for payments. Third-party processors (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, Bitcoin) handle credit card and other payment methods. Payment data is limited, with only necessary details retained.

### 2.10 Native Applications

Our native applications may use analytics and crash reporting. Mobile platforms may collect aggregate statistics governed by their privacy policies.

### 2.11 Proton Scribe

Proton Scribe, our writing assistant, operates locally on your device by default. You may opt for server-side processing, in which minimal data is shared for service functionality.

### 2.12 Dark Web Monitor

This feature, when enabled, scans for breached data. User data is not shared with third parties.

### 2.13 Social Media

We are active on platforms like **Facebook**, **Instagram**, **LinkedIn**, **Twitter**, **Reddit**, and **Mastodon**. Any information shared on these platforms is governed by their privacy policies.

### 2.14 External Links and Embedded Content

We may link to third-party websites or use embedded content. **External sites** are governed by their own terms and privacy policies.

## 3. Network Traffic and Third Parties

Our alternative routing technology enables Proton Services to bypass censorship but may result in network traffic passing through third-party networks. These parties cannot see encrypted data. **Alternative routing** can be disabled in settings.
