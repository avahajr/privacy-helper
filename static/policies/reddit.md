# Reddit Privacy Policy

**Effective**: August 16, 2024
**Last Revised**: August 16, 2024

---

## Introduction

At Reddit, we believe that privacy is a right. We want to empower our users to be the masters of their identity. In this privacy policy, we want to help you understand how and why Reddit (“Reddit,” “we” or “us”) collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our websites, mobile apps, widgets, APIs, emails, and other online products and services (collectively, the “Services”) or when you otherwise interact with us or receive a communication from us.

We want this privacy policy to empower you to make better choices about how you use Reddit. We'd love for you to read the whole policy, but if you don't, here is the TL;DR:

### TL;DR
- **Reddit is a public platform**: Our communities are largely public, and anyone can see your profile, posts, and comments.
- **Minimal information collection**: By default, we collect minimal identifying information. Browsing can be done without an account, and account creation doesn’t require a real name.
- **Data usage**: We only use data to improve Reddit. We don't sell your personal data to third parties and do not work with data brokers.
- **Privacy rights for everyone**: All users, regardless of location, can request a copy of their data, account deletion, or information about our policies.
- **Questions? Just ask**: If anything is unclear, we're here to help.

## Reddit Is a Public Platform

Much of the information on the Services is public and accessible to everyone, even without an account. By using the Services, you are directing us to share this information publicly and freely.

When you submit content (e.g., a post, comment, or chat message) to a public part of the Services, any visitors to and users of our Services will be able to see that content, the username associated with the content, and the date and time you originally submitted it. That content and information may also appear in search results on internet search engines like Google or in responses provided by an AI chatbot like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. You should take the public nature of the Services into consideration before posting.

Your Reddit account has a **profile page** that is public. Your profile contains information about your activities on the Services, such as:
- Your username
- Prior posts and comments
- Karma
- Trophies received
- Profile display name
- About section, social links, avatar or profile image
- Moderator, contributor, and Reddit Premium status
- Communities you are active in
- How long you have been a member of the Services (your “cake day”)

We offer social sharing features that let you share content or actions you take on our Services with other media. Your use of these features enables the sharing of certain information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the third parties that provide these social sharing features (e.g., Tumblr, Facebook, and X).

Reddit allows moderators to access Reddit content using moderator bots and tools. Additionally, Reddit allows other third parties to access public Reddit content using Reddit’s developer services, including:
- Reddit Embeds
- Our APIs
- Developer Platform
- Similar technologies

We limit third-party access to this content and require third parties to pay licensing fees for access to larger quantities of content. [Reddit’s Developer Terms](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/data-api-terms) govern how these services are used by third parties. Please review our [public content policy here](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) for more information about how your public content is publicly available and accessible to anyone with access to the internet.

### Information You Provide to Us

We collect information you provide directly when you use the Services. This includes:

#### Account Information
You don't need an account to use Reddit. If you create an account, it will have a username, which can be provided by you or generated automatically. Your username is public and does not need to be related to your real name. Depending on whether you register via email, Single Sign-On (SSO) (like Apple or Google), or phone number, you may need to provide a password. If your account doesn’t have a password, we may send an SMS message for verification. During account creation, we may ask you to select interests (e.g., history, nature, sports) or communities (e.g., r/technology) to customize your home feed.

When using Reddit, you may provide additional information, such as a bio, gender, age, location, profile picture, or social links. This information is optional and can be removed at any time. We also store your account preferences and settings. We may request information before you create an account to improve your experience.

#### Non-Public Content You Submit
In addition to public content, we collect non-public content, including drafts of posts or comments, private messages, chats, modmail, and reports or communications with moderators or us. This content may contain text, links, images, GIFs, audio, video, software, and tools.

#### Actions You Take
We collect information on actions you take when using the Services, such as voting, saving, hiding, and reporting content. This includes your interactions with other users (e.g., following, blocking) and with communities (e.g., subscriptions, moderator status).

#### Transactional Information
If you purchase products or services from Reddit, you will need to provide payment information. Reddit uses industry-standard payment processors (e.g., Stripe), which are governed by separate terms and privacy policies. We collect information on the product or service purchased, such as purchase dates, amounts, and renewal dates.

We may also collect public blockchain data and addresses if you purchase or create a Collectible Avatar, receive or mint an NFT, or use Reddit Vault. However, Reddit does not store Vault private key information.

#### Other Information
You may provide other information directly to us. For instance, we may collect information when you fill out forms, surveys, participate in Reddit-sponsored activities, promotions, or programs, apply for a job, request customer support, or communicate with us.

### Information We Collect Automatically

When you access or use our Services, we may automatically collect information about you. This includes:

#### Log and Usage Data
We may log information when you access and use the Services. This data may include:
- **IP address**
- **User-agent string**
- **Browser type and operating system**
- **Referral URLs**
- **Device information** (such as device IDs, device settings, and mobile carrier name)
- **Pages visited, links clicked, requested URLs, and search terms**

Except for the IP address used to create your account, Reddit will delete IP addresses collected after 100 days.

#### Information Collected from Cookies and Similar Technologies
We may receive information from cookies—small data files stored by your browser that send data back to us during requests—and similar technologies. This data helps us:
- Deliver and maintain our Services
- Improve user experience and understand activity
- Personalize content and advertisements
- Measure advertising effectiveness
- Improve Service quality

For instance, we store and retrieve data about your preferred language and other settings. For more details on how Reddit uses cookies, see our [Cookie Notice](#). For instructions on how to disable cookies, refer to the “Your Choices” section below.

#### Location Information
We may receive and process information about your location. This data can be collected when you:
- Choose to share location information via the **Location Customization** setting
- Associate content with a location

Alternatively, we may approximate your location based on your IP address.

### Information Collected from Other Sources

We may obtain information about you from additional sources, such as other users and third parties, and combine this with other data we have about you. Examples include:

#### Demographic and Interest Information
We may receive information about your demographics or interests from third parties, like advertisers. For example, an advertiser may provide data indicating they want to show you specific ads. We may link this data with information you’ve provided to Reddit by using a common account identifier, such as a hash of your email address or a mobile-device ID. You can control how this information is used to personalize ads in the **User Settings** of your account, as explained in the “Your Rights and Choices” section below.

#### Linked Services
If you authorize a third-party service (such as an unofficial Reddit app) to access your Reddit account, Reddit will receive data about your use of that service, which may also share your account information with Reddit. For instance, if you sign in to Reddit via a third-party identity provider, the provider may share your email address with us. For more details on sharing information with linked services, see the “How Information About You Is Shared” section below.

#### Information from Integrated Services
We may also receive data about you, including log, usage, and cookie information, from third-party sites that integrate with our Services (e.g., sites using Reddit embeds or our advertising technology). For example:
- **Reddit Embeds**: When you visit a website that includes Reddit embeds, we may receive information about the webpage you visited.
- **Advertising Technology**: If an advertiser uses Reddit’s ad tech, we may receive limited data about your actions on their site or app, such as a record of purchases made.

To control how this data is used to personalize your experience on Reddit, refer to **Your Choices - Controlling Advertising and Analytics** below.

### Information Collected by Third Parties

#### Embedded Content
Reddit includes some linked content directly within the platform through embeds. For instance, Reddit posts linking to YouTube or X (formerly Twitter) may display the video or tweet directly in your Reddit feed. This setup allows you to view content without leaving Reddit. However, Reddit does not control the data practices of these third-party services when they serve their embedded content directly to your device. Consequently, data collected through embedded content is governed by the privacy policies of the respective third-party services, not Reddit’s.

#### Audience Measurement
Reddit partners with audience measurement providers to gather demographic insights about Reddit’s user base. These service providers collect information through cookies to identify your device and analyze audience demographics.

### Information Collected from Advertisers and Potential Advertisers
If you use **Reddit Ads** (Reddit’s self-serve advertising platform at ads.reddit.com) on behalf of your business or organization, Reddit collects additional information. To sign up, you must provide your name, email address, and company information. Reddit may also publicly disclose certain details about your company to meet legal requirements. When purchasing advertising services, you’ll need to provide transactional details as previously described, and Reddit may require further documentation to verify your identity. Additionally, Reddit may record session replays of your visits to the Ads platform for purposes like customer service, troubleshooting, and usability research.

### Information Collected from Reddit Pro Users
If you enroll in **Reddit Pro** (on behalf of yourself, your business, or organization), Reddit collects additional information, such as profile type, name, industry category, website, and organization size (if applicable). For specific Reddit Pro features, Reddit may request additional verification documents.

### Information Collected from Reddit Program Participants and Potential Participants
If you sign up to participate in a Reddit Program (for example, our Contributor Program), we collect, directly or indirectly through our providers, some additional information from you (such as your name, date of birth, address, email, tax, government ID, and payment information). This additional information is used and shared with our third-party payment and compliance providers to determine your eligibility to participate in the applicable Reddit Program, facilitate payments, and comply with law. Those providers and their services are subject to separate terms and conditions and privacy policies.

### How We Use Information

We use the information about you to:

- Provide, maintain, and improve the Services.
- Personalize services, content, and features that align with your activities, preferences, and settings.
- Help protect the safety of Reddit and our users, including blocking suspected spammers, addressing abuse, and enforcing the Reddit User Agreement and our other terms and policies, as well as complying with applicable law.
- Provide, optimize, target, and measure the effectiveness of ads shown on our Services.
- Research and develop new services.
- Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, invoices, and other support and administrative messages.
- Provide customer service.
- Communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, events, and programs, and provide other news and information we believe may be of interest to you. (For information about how to opt out of these communications, see "Your Choices" below.)
- Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with our Services.

### How We Share Information

In addition to the content displayed publicly as described above, we may share information in the following ways:

- **With your consent**: We may share information about you with your consent or at your direction, such as when you use social sharing features to share content with third-party sites like Tumblr and X.
- **With linked services**: If you link your Reddit account with a third-party service, Reddit will share the information you authorize with that third-party service. You can control this sharing as described in "Your Rights and Choices" below.
- **With our service providers**: We may share information with vendors, consultants, and other service providers who need access to such information to perform work for us. Examples include:
    - Payment processors who handle transactions.
    - Cloud providers hosting our data and services.
    - Third-party ads measurement providers who help us and advertisers measure ad performance.
    - Compliance providers who help us determine your eligibility for Reddit Programs.
- **To comply with the law**: We may share information if we believe disclosure is required by any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, including national security or law enforcement requests. We will attempt to provide prior notice before disclosing information, to the extent the law allows. Our Transparency Report provides more information on how we respond to government requests.
- **In an emergency**: We may share information if necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person.
- **To enforce our rights and promote safety and security**: We may share information if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our User Agreement, rules, or other Reddit terms and policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of Reddit, our Services, and others.
- **With our affiliates**: We may share information between and among Reddit, our parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership.
- **Aggregated or de-identified information**: We may share aggregated or anonymized information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we might show the total number of upvotes on a post without identifying specific users, or tell an advertiser how many people viewed their ad.

### How We Protect Your Information

We take measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. For example:

- We use **HTTPS** to ensure secure transmission of information.
- We enforce **technical and administrative access controls** to limit which of our employees have access to non-public personal information.

You can help maintain the security of your account by enabling **two-factor authentication**.

We store the information we collect for as long as it is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it. We may retain certain information for legitimate business purposes and/or if required by applicable law. For example, if you violate our policies and your account is suspended or banned, we may store identifiers used to create the account (such as phone number) to prevent you from creating new accounts.

### Your Rights and Choices

You have choices about how to protect and limit the collection, use, and sharing of information about you when you use the Services. Depending on where you live, you may also have the following rights:

- **Correction/rectification** of your personal information.
- **Opting out** of certain advertising practices.
- **Withdrawal of consent** for processing, where you have previously provided consent.

Reddit does not discriminate against users for exercising their rights under data protection laws.

### Accessing and Changing Your Information

You can access your information and change or correct certain information through the Services. For more information, visit our [Help Center](#). You can also request a copy of the personal information Reddit maintains about you by following the process described [here](#).

### Deleting Your Account

You may delete your account information at any time from the user preferences page. For more information, visit our [Help Center](#). When you delete your account:
- Your profile is no longer visible to other users and disassociated from content you posted under that account.
- However, posts, comments, and messages you submitted prior to deleting your account will still be visible to others unless you first delete the specific content.

After you submit a request to delete your account, our purge script begins the deletion process within 90 days. After running our purge script, Reddit will not be able to provide access to deleted data. We may also retain certain information for legitimate business purposes and/or if required by law.

### Controlling Linked Services' Access to Your Account

You can review the services you've permitted to access your account and revoke access to individual services by visiting:
- The **Apps page** (for third-party app authorizations),
- The **Connected Accounts section** of your Account Settings (for Google Sign-In, Sign in with Apple, and connected X accounts),
- The **Social links section** of your Profile Settings.

### Controlling Personalized Advertising

You may opt out of us using information we collect from third parties, including advertising partners, to personalize the ads you see on Reddit. To do so, visit the **Privacy section** of the User Settings in your account (if using desktop) or in your **Account Settings** if using the Reddit mobile app.

### Controlling the Use of Cookies

Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually set your browser to remove or reject first- and third-party cookies. However, this may affect the availability and functionality of our Services. For more information on controlling how cookies and similar technologies are used on Reddit, see our [Cookie Notice](#).

### Controlling Advertising and Analytics

Some analytics providers we partner with may provide specific opt-out mechanisms, and we may offer additional tools and third-party services to manage cookies and opt out. For example, you may manage the use of certain information by Google Analytics via the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](#). You can also opt out of the Audience Measurement services provided by Nielsen and Quantcast.

Additionally, you may opt out of receiving personalized advertisements from certain third-party advertisers and ad networks by visiting:
- [Digital Advertising Alliance](#)
- [Network Advertising Initiative](#)
- [Your Online Choices](#) (for users in the European Economic Area)

### Do Not Track

Most modern web browsers give you the option to send a **Do Not Track** signal to the sites you visit, indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. However, there is no accepted standard for how a site should respond to this signal, and we do not take action in response. Instead, we offer you the choices described in this policy to manage the collection and use of information about you.

### Controlling Promotional Communications

You may opt out of receiving some or all categories of promotional communications from us by following the instructions in those communications or by updating your email options in your account preferences [here](#). If you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as information about your account or your use of the Services.

### Controlling Mobile Notifications

With your consent, we may send promotional and non-promotional push notifications or alerts to your mobile device. You can deactivate these messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your mobile device.

### Controlling Location Information

You can control how we use location information for feed and recommendations customization via the **Location Customization setting** in your Account Settings.
### Contacting Reddit for Data Requests

If you have questions or are unable to submit a request to exercise your rights using the mechanisms described earlier, you can email us at **redditdatarequests@reddit.com** from the email address that is verified with your Reddit account, or submit a request through our designated platform.

Before processing your request regarding your personal information, we will verify your identity by confirming access to your Reddit account or a verified email address associated with your account. If your request is denied, you have the right to appeal by contacting us at **redditdatarequests@reddit.com**.

### International Data Transfers

Reddit, Inc. is based in the United States, and we process and store information on servers located within the United States. In some cases, we may store information on servers in other countries, depending on factors such as user location and service provider locations. By accessing or using our Services or providing information to us, you consent to the processing, transfer, and storage of your information in the United States and other countries where privacy rights may differ from those in your home country.

When transferring personal data of users in the EEA, UK, and/or Switzerland, Reddit relies on Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission or other mechanisms deemed ‘adequate’ under applicable laws.

### EU-U.S., UK Extension, and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks Disclosure

Reddit complies with the **EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF)**, the **UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF**, and the **Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF)** as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Reddit has certified that it adheres to the EU-U.S. DPF Principles for the processing of personal data received from the European Union and the United Kingdom, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles for data from Switzerland.

If there is a conflict between the terms of this Privacy Policy and the DPF Principles, the Principles will govern. For more information on the **Data Privacy Framework (DPF)** Program and to view Reddit's certification, visit [Data Privacy Framework](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/).

Reddit's compliance with the DPF is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Reddit is also responsible for onward transfers of personal data to third parties that do not comply with the DPF, unless Reddit was not responsible for the event that caused the alleged damage.

In some cases, the DPF framework allows you to invoke binding arbitration to resolve complaints that have not been addressed by other means. To do so, you can refer unresolved complaints to **JAMS**, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States. If you do not receive a timely acknowledgment of your complaint or if it remains unresolved, please visit [JAMS DPF Dispute Resolution](https://www.jamsadr.com/dpf-dispute-resolution) for more details or to file a complaint. JAMS' services are provided at no cost to you.

### Additional Information for EEA and UK Users

If you reside in the **European Economic Area (EEA)**, **Reddit Netherlands B.V.** is the controller of your information processed in connection with the Reddit platform and this policy. If you reside in the **United Kingdom (UK)**, **Reddit, Inc.** is the data controller, and **Reddit UK Limited** serves as Reddit’s UK GDPR Article 27 Representative.

Users in the EEA and UK have specific rights, including the right to:

These rights can be exercised as detailed in the **“Your Rights and Choices”** section above. EEA users also have the right to lodge a complaint with their local supervisory authority.

As required by law, we collect and process personal information only when we have a valid legal basis. The legal bases for processing include:

- **Contractual Necessity**: Processing is required to fulfill our contract with you, such as providing, operating, and improving the Services, customer support, personalization, and ensuring security.
- **Legitimate Interests**: Processing for legitimate business interests, such as preventing fraud, ensuring security, enforcing policies, protecting legal rights, and marketing.
- **Consent**: Where you have explicitly consented to the processing of your information for specific purposes.

It is recommended that you regularly review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how your information is being handled and the steps you can take to protect your privacy. By continuing to use the Services after these changes go into effect, you agree to the updated Privacy Policy.
